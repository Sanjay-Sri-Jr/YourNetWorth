## 👩🏻‍💻 ABSTRACT — Your Net Worth: AI-Powered Personal Finance Platform

In the digital economy, individuals increasingly struggle to manage their financial activities, monitor spending patterns, and make informed financial decisions. Traditional finance-tracking applications offer static dashboards but lack intelligent analysis that adapts to a user’s personal financial behavior. To address this challenge, Your Net Worth is developed as an AI-powered personal finance management platform that provides real-time tracking, visualization, and intelligent insights based on the user’s financial data.

This platform combines the capabilities of Next.js, Supabase PostgreSQL, Drizzle ORM, and Groq’s LLaMA-3 AI models to create an interactive and data-driven solution. Users can securely authenticate, record income and expense transactions, and view dynamic dashboards that visualize their financial trends through charts and reports. Advanced AI integration enables the system to analyze historical transaction data, detect spending patterns, predict savings opportunities, and answer user queries in natural language.

The system aims to deliver a personalized financial assistant that enhances financial literacy and decision-making. By blending modern full-stack development with AI-based analytics, Your Net Worth provides a smart, user-friendly, and insightful finance management solution suitable for students, working professionals, and anyone seeking better control over their finances. The project demonstrates practical implementation of AI-driven analytics and serves as a robust and scalable model for next-generation personal finance platforms.
